    <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
    <p>Our company's goal is to help East African vendors, women in particular, as they develop and expand sales of their products within their communities and across borders. Our goal is to provide resources and information that will allow vendors to share their products and culture and become self-sufficient. This support will identify potential markets, explain trade regulations and set fair prices in foreign markets, as well as provide faster networking between vendors within their own communities.</p>
